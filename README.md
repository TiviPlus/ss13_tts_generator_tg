# SS13 Text-to-Speech Generator

Using the [SharpTalk](https://github.com/whatsecretproject/SharpTalk) library and OggEnc.exe which is available with [WinVorbis](http://www.stationplaylist.com/winvorbis/), this program will take in text and generate a .wav and .ogg file. The .ogg is used for SS13 to allow servers to generate text-to-speech sound files.
